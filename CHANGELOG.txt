Release notes
-------------
 Sometimes after shutting down GIS.lab server ($ vagrant halt) it is not possible to launch it
 again ($ vagrant up). The reason is that GRUB boot loader is endlessly waiting for manual input.
 To solve this problem shut down server machine using VirtualBox Manager GUI and uncomment
 line 'v.gui = true' in 'Vagrantfile' file. Start GIS.lab server again ($ vagrant up) and press
 ENTER in server's GUI console to boot. 


Version 0.2.1

Changes
-------
 * fixed NFS share user id mapping
 * enabling server GUI console by default as workaround to GRUB problem
