# GIS data processing and analysis
GIS software provided by GIS.lab can successfully read and write large number of spatial data formats like _AutoCAD DXF, ESRI Shapefile, GeoJSON, GML, GeoJPEG, KML, Microstation DGN v.7, OpenStreetMap XML and PBF, SQLite/SpatiaLite, TIFF/GeoTIFF, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, MS SQL Spatial, Oracle Spatial, OGC WMS and WFS_ and many more. Most of the world's spatial reference systems (SRS) are transparently handled by on-the-fly reprojection to choosen destination SRS of project. Geometry and attribute data can be created and modified by advanced geometry editing, data processing tools and analysis.
