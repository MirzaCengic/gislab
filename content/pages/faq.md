### What is a difference between OSGeo Live DVD and GIS.lab ?
OSGeo Live DVD tries to package every possible free GIS software to one media and provide fantastic tool
for presentations or workshops. I opposite, GIS.lab contains only one and the best tool for one
task. We focus on seamless integration of all software packages to provide clear work flow starting
from data creation and storage, towards analysis and project publication on web. Also, we are actively
developing new software for our software stack (for example GIS.lab Web).

GIS.lab infrastructure is built on top of dedicated server and client systems and provides possibilities
to deploy on local computer and in cloud as well. I think this is also out of scope of OSGeo Live DVD.


### Why are you developing your own web client instead of using and contributing to QGIS Web Client ?
At the beginning, we really intended to use QGIS Web Client (QWC) as our web front end application,
but when we analysed it's suitability for our needs and future plans, we have discovered that we
need too much tweaks and features which may not be useful for general usage at all.
That is the reason we have started with development of GIS.lab Web.


### Is GIS.lab in production ready state ?
Although we already use GIS.lab for some serious projects, it is hard to use it for production
purposes for people from outside of project because of lack of documentation and backward incompatible
changes between major releases. This will change with release of version 1.0. If you like GIS.lab and
want to use it as soon as possible, please contact us. We will surely find a way to help you.
