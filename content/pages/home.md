# Any computer can be a GIS.lab client
__GIS.lab server__ runs in virtual machine which successfully works without any difference on Linux, Windows or Mac OS X. It is really up to user's preferences which platform to choose.

Preferred method of launching __GIS.lab client__ machine is a __physical client mode__. In this mode, client machine is configured to boot a new GIS.lab client environment from GIS.lab server network service. Access to original operating system is temporary lost (it can be restored after machine restart without any changes or a danger of loosing data). This mode provides best performance.

In case user can't offer loosing access to a system physically installed on client machine, there is a possibility to launch __GIS.lab client__ inside of any Windows, Linux or Mac OS X operating system in __virtual client mode__. This mode will boot the same client environment from GIS.lab server network service inside of VirtualBox machine and will allow to run both systems side-by-side. It is possible use GIS.lab virtual client in a windowed mode, similar as it would be a standard application or in a fullscreen mode for best user experience.
